Crafting talisman concept (Forgery and refinery are able to do it)
Six categories - basic, common, middle, high, rare and perfect
Three types - Protection (skills like golden armor, heal, fast movement), traps (skills like energy cage, sinking feet, prevent move) and offense (like firewall, 
earthquake, whirlwind)
Talisman can be crafted after the Master rank and asking for a tutor from the academy.
You need to talk to the professor from forgery or refinery in order to have permission to ask for a tutor.
Any Master or greater that already finished the talisman training can be a tutor, but the better the tutor, the better you need to be so they will have you as a aprentice.


Definitions of the academy -
The place where you can train and become better, after you finish the "main" First Quest, you need to be accepted in the academy to keep going on the story.
Your acceptance depends If you did one of the following things:
1. Get the primary weapon (sword, staff, bow or deffensive weapons [yet to decide])
2. Look for a way to develop yourself when you reach the kingdom for the first time.

If you did one of the following situations, you will be invited to learn in the academy. 
But they'll ask for you to be on lvl200 before really joining in.
There you'll learn about the professions and how to properly level up.


Main Quest (1~200)
Save the Princess.
You are a simple peasant, living only with your father and working hard everyday... You want something more, something better.
